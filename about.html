<section class="container">
	<p>Imagine this: You're writing an essay for your English class. You've just started a few hours ago. You're barely on your second page when you receive a message from one of your fellow classmates: "Outstanding Introduction You're really capturing the reader! Just make sure you don't forget your Oxford Commas!". You then return the favor and comment on their introduction. You're now feeling good and confident that you're on the right track. But you're now on the lookout for your commas.</p>
<p>Now, how is this possible you ask? It used to be that you had to wait days to receive feedback on your essay. But not any more. With Chunkr, students can receive feedback on their essays from both their teachers and their peers. </p>
<p>How does it work? Simple! You register an account with chunkr and connect to your class. Then, you upload your document whenever you're looking for feedback. Chunkr's SmartParser automatically separates your file into intelligent "chunks" which can each be evaluated individually. Any of your classmates can give you feedback on your essay, and you can return the favor for any of your peers. </p>
<p>With Chunkr, you can receive immediate feedback when you need it. You can choose which “chunks” you share, so you're in control of the whole process. Chuckr makes writing essays easier, more fun, and enjoyable.</p>
